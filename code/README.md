# ðŸ’» Code for MOACO-based Sentiment Analysis

This directory contains the implementation of our research work:  
**"From ACO to MOACO: Enhancing Sentiment Analysis via Multi-Objective Feature Selection and LSTM Networks"**

The code demonstrates how to use **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** and **Multi-Objective ACO (MOACO)** for feature selection on the **Sentiment140 dataset**, followed by classification using **BiLSTM networks**.
